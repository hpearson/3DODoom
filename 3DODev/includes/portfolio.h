**  Lib3DO common header files for 3DO (more than you probably need).
**
**  Think twice before including this file.  It includes way more stuff
**  than any single source module is likely to need.  Using this header
**  file will cost an awful lot in terms of wasted compile time.  You're
**  much better off identifying which OS and Lib3DO header files you
**  actually need, and including just those from within your source code.
